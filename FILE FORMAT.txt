LOG file format:
    lines can start with one of: "F" (focus change), "L" (locked/unlocked), "U" (user change), "P" (process start/end), "I" (initial run of program), "A" (user activity)

    format for each line start:
        T,date(YYYY-MM-DD),time(HH-MM-SS.ZZZZ)
        which indicates a datetime change for the following lines
        this was implemented to reduce redundancy in lines in the previous format
        what this means is that all lines below this line were written at this datetime, until another T line which will update the datetime again

        F,PID(int),name(str)
        which means that process with process ID "PID" and name "name" is now in focus, and whatever process that was previously in focus no longer is

        L,is_locked(bool)
        which simply indicates a change in the locked status of the computer, and is_locked is true if the computer is locked, else false

        U,current_user(str)
        which indicates a change in the currently logged in user

        P,PID(int),name(str),start/end
        which indicates that a process "PID" has either started or ended since the last time the script checked for running programs

        A,time_since_last_user_activity(float)
        which indicates a change in time since last user activity
        if this is an "I" line, time should be 0 (or near 0)
        if no user activity is detected, no new A lines will be added, when user activity is detected, a new A line will be added on the next log cycle

        I,[]
        where [] is any other line format as described above
        the lines written to the log file on startup of the script will have this format, and are otherwise identical to normal lines
        the reason this distinction exists is that lines from the first run can be redundant or contain "outdated" information, and should be treated separately
